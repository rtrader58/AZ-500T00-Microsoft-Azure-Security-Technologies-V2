Task 3: Enable the Log Analytics virtual machine extension <br>
Step 1: Before beginning this task, ensure that the Log Analytics Workspace deployment has completed successfully, it should take 1-2 minutes<br>
Step 2 – if the VM is not listed, wait a few minutes and then refresh the view. It can take up to 15 minutes for the VM to appear in the list. Also, verify that the VM you created in Task 1 is Running.<br>
Step 4 - 5: It can take a few minutes to connect.  (On 11/5/2021 this took 2.5 minutes) This is a great time to stretch & hydrate!<br>

Task 5: View and query collected data<br>
Step 3: Close the video in the details section of this page, and ignore the instruction to click “get started”<br>
Step 4: Navigate to the Virtual Machines queries in the All Queries column or use Search<br>
Step 5: It doesn’t matter which queries you run, this task is to show you VM log data being gathered. Note that some queries will have no results as not enough data has been gathered yet.<br>
